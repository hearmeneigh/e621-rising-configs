# OS Setup Scripts

> Convenience installer scripts that install Dataset Rising on top of a vanilla OS installation
>
> You will only need to do run this script if you are setting up a new machine for training,
> for example a new EC2, Google Cloud, Vast AI, RunPod, etc. instance. 
>
> **You do not need to run these scripts on your local machine.**
